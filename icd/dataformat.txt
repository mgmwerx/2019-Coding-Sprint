That is the “calendar” object.  But it’s an Event in our model.
and the starts_at, ends_at, created_at, last_updated are firebase Timestamps that we turn into native time objects.  For Swift we use a Date() and for Kotlin it’s a LocalDate()

Android is a Date() and Calendar(), correction from Kevin
